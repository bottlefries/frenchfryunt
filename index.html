        <br>
        <p class="meep">The main menu music of The Last Of Us is calming even though the game itself is full of fear inducing gameplay. Every time the player starts or saves the game, this music plays in the background. This is something that adds to the game as if it is mentally preparing the player to prepare for intense anxiety driven combat.</p><br>

        <p class="meep"><b>The Narrative Arc</b></p><br>
        <br>
        <p class="meep">The Last Of Us is a survival action-adventure game that takes place in a post-pandemic world. In this world, cordyceps have mutated humans causing them to infect everyone they bite or whoever breathes in the spores. The main characters are Joel and Ellie. For most of the game, you play as Joel. The goal of the game is to take Ellie, who is immune to the cordyceps, across the country, to a hospital run by the Fireflies in hopes of finding a cure. </p><br>
<br>
        <p class="meep">In this website, we will be looking at the relationship between Joel and Ellie throughout the game and how it impacts what is at stake in the game and the emotional aspects of the game.</p><br>
<br>
<br>
        <p class="meep"><b>The "Beginning"</b></p><br>
        <br>
         <p class="meep">In the first scene of the game, it starts out with the beginning of the pandemic, featuring Joel and his daughter Sarah Miller. This scene shows the raw emotions of a father losing his child. It leaves the player entranced in the moment, feeling as if you were the one losing a loved one. This is a key defining moment in Joel's life and impacts how Joel sees Ellie in the game. When Joel meets Ellie for the first time, he just thinks of her as extra cargo that needs to be taken care of so he can get what he needs to find his brother Tommy. However, he protects Ellie with his life even while mistrusting her in the beginning, especially when he finds out she had been bitten and could not believe she was immune.</p><br>
<br>
<br>
        <p class="meep"><b>The "Middle"</b></p><br>
        <br>
        <p class="meep">In the first scene of the game, it starts out with the beginning of the pandemic, featuring Joel and his daughter Sarah Miller. This scene shows the raw emotions of a father losing his child. It leaves the player entranced in the moment, feeling as if you were the one losing a loved one. This is a key defining moment in Joel's life and impacts how Joel sees Ellie in the game. When Joel meets Ellie for the first time, he just thinks of her as extra cargo that needs to be taken care of so he can get what he needs to find his brother Tommy. However, he protects Ellie with his life even while mistrusting her in the beginning, especially when he finds out she had been bitten and could not believe she was immune.</p><br>
<br>
<br>
        <p class="meep"><b>The "End"</b></p><br>
        <br>
         <p class="meep">By the end of the game, Joel takes Ellie to the hospital and finds out that they will need to kill her in order to potentially find a cure. This is a critical moment in the game because you play as Joel, raging and ravaging the hospital in order to save Ellie from dying. As you play, you become filled with so many emotions, you become one with Joel, searching for Ellie before it is too late. Since the beginning of the game showed Sarah dying in his arms, and the rest of the game is Joel bonding with Ellie, she starts to become an adopted daughter in Joel's eyes. So when the ending shows parallels to Sarah's death, the game plays onto the player's emotional heartstrings. The game ends with Joel carrying Ellie to safety and driving away to find his brother Tommy.</p><br>
<br>
<br>
        <p class="meep"><b>What Is At Stake?</b></p><br>
        <br>
        <p class="meep">There are two viewpoints as to what is at stake in this game. The first being that there is a chance that humans can find a cure and be immune to the cordyceps if Ellie gives up her life to science. The second viewpoint is Joel's, and how if he gives Ellie to science, he will lose another daughter in his life, and experience life long grief. However, there is also the point that if he saves Ellie, he can live keeping Ellie safe but in return, humanity never gets a chance at finding a cure.</p><br>

<br>
        <p class="meep"><b>Left Behind (Bonus Content)</b></p><br>
            <br>
<p class="meep">Left Behind is a bonus chapter featuring the events that happened prior to Ellie getting bitten. It takes you through a fun and playful chapter where Ellie and her best friend Riley sneak into an abandoned mall. Ellie and Riley both get bitten however Riley dies and Ellie survives. This is heartbreaking because Riley was Ellie's love interest.</p><br>
<br>
<br>
<p class="meep"><b>What The Game Means To Me</b></p><br>
            <br>
<p class="meep">The Last Of Us means a lot to me emotionally. I relate to Ellie and Joel's relationship to a certain degree. I understand the emotional pull between the characters and how they care for each other even when they are mad at each other. I also understand Ellie's pain in her bonus chapter with how she loses her best friend and love interest. One of my favorite parts of the game is the scenes with Ellie and Sam. Their relationship is beautifully pure despite the chaos that is happening around them. In the game, Sam gets bitten, leaving Ellie to try and save him by sharing her blood in hopes of it curing him. This specific moment shows her heart and how she wants to have a purpose and help people, while also dealing with her loss of her best friend Riley and everyone else she loved.</p><br>

 <br>
<p class="meep"><b>TLOU & Baudrilliard </b></p><br>
<br>
<p class="meep">The game relates to Baudrilliard and is a simulacrum since it pushes the player to feel the emotions of loss and grief and makes it feel more than real. Since the entirety of the game the player plays as Joel protecting Ellie, by the end of the game, the desire and need to protect her from dying takes over reality. This makes the survival gameplay more real than reality since all the player is left to think about is protecting and saving Ellie from impending death.</p><br>
